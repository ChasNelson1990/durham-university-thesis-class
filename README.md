## Durham University Thesis Class
This repository contains an early and simplistic demo of my thesis class and style files, as used to prepare by PhD thesis at Durham University.

- by **Carl J. Nelson**

## Overview
This repository provides a LaTex class file (based on the report class) and style file (automatically loaded by the class) for a consistent PhD thesis style.

This key features are:
1. Consistent styling of Contents, List of Tables, List of Figures and List of Algorithms
2. Custom heders and footers
3. Some specialised environments mostly used by me (you probably won't need these)
4. The Durham University colour palette
5. Citations and cross-referencing with back-referencing (note I use BibLaTeX and not BibTex)

Please create issues if you'd like features to be added

For general usage:
- Use it like you would any class file!
